# pythonemail

###
Description


I have a partner that wants to send out emails to business clients and I recalled I saw that python had that ability.   So I decided to see if I can get such a thing to work and give him another option. While I was coding I would like to thank chilled hip-hop and neo-soul #10 on youtube for providing background sounds.

Running the program


At this time can be run from the terminal by using python emailpy.py.  Of course you have to have python installed.
