# pythonemail

###
Description
I have a partner that wants to send out mass emails and I recalled I saw that python had that ability.   So I decided to see if I can get such a thing to working and give him another option. While I was coding I would like to thank chilled hip-hop and neo-soul on youtube for providing background sounds.

Running the program
At this time can be run from the terminal by using python3 emailpy.py or version you are interested in.  Of course you have to have python installed
